File Sharing app

File sharing that works almost like Dropbox. You run server at the computer that you want to upload your files to and Client from your current working machine. 
By dropping files at the client's folder the files are automatically being sent to the server's folder.
It is currently functional only for the "update" and "create" file functions. Not for the "delete".
